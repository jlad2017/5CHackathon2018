BIG HACKZ

This is a Course Planning website for Pomona College students. Right now, only the Computer Science and Dance links work (lol) but if you are one of those majors, you're in luck! :) 

Also we built a Python program using selenium, pandas, and BeautifulSoup that scrapes data off of the Pomona Course Catalog to get the course ID numbers/course titles, and it does a cool thing with a webdriver object that you should check out!
